Yarn is surprisingly simple once you get used to it.

Here's some steps.
1. Open Yarn
2. Edit the Node title to be whatever condition you want it to be activated under (IE: "Use" for when you use the item)
3. Add dialogue
4. Remember to save as a Yarn file!
5. Direct DialogueRunner (the ingame object) to the file. Add dialogue slots if you need to.

Optional: Add NPC script to object and direct it to the proper nodes.
